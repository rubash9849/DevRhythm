# DevRhythm

**DevRhythm** is a lightweight research-oriented PyCharm/IntelliJ plugin that tracks developers’ coding and idle activity patterns.  
It helps researchers and educators study how programming rhythm and self-regulation evolve during software development sessions.

- Break frequency and duration  
- Active vs. idle intervals during programming sessions  
- Data collection for educational and cognitive analysis

This is a harmless internal resource-disposal notice and does **not** affect:
- plugin performance  
- user data
