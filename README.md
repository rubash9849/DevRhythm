DevRhythm

DevRhythm is a lightweight research-oriented PyCharm/IntelliJ plugin that tracks developers’ coding and idle activity patterns.
It helps researchers and educators study how programming rhythm and self-regulation evolve during software development sessions.
Activity is measured using keystrokes and mouse clicks, enabling fine-grained detection of active and idle programming behavior.
🎯 Purpose

This plugin is part of an ongoing research initiative at Utah State University, led by Dr. John Edwards and developed by Rubash Mali, focused on exploring self-regulated learning behaviors in programming contexts.

DevRhythm provides insights into:

Coding rhythm and time distribution

Break frequency and duration

Active vs. idle intervals during programming sessions

Data collection for educational and cognitive analysis

⚙️ Features

🧠 Tracks active vs. idle developer time in real time

🪶 Logs data into a project-level folder named .devrythm

🧾 Generates timestamped CSV logs for research or personal analytics

💡 Displays a status-bar widget that updates between “Active” and “Idle” states

🔔 During extended inactivity, the status bar gently blinks every 5 minutes as a reminder.

🌐 Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

🔧 Updated for PyCharm 2024–2025 with deprecated API fixes and improved IntelliJ Platform compatibility (241–252.*)
